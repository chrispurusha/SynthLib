// A single-producer / single-consumer ring, written by one audio callback and read by another.
//
// THE CURSORS ARE ABSOLUTE FRAME COUNTS, NOT BUFFER INDICES. That is taken from JUCE's
// AudioIODeviceCombiner (juce_CoreAudio_mac.cpp), and it is the single most useful idea in that
// file. Two consequences follow that head/tail indices do not give:
//
//   - Overflow and underrun become plain arithmetic on two monotonic numbers, rather than the
//     usual "is the gap wrapped or not" case analysis that is so easy to get subtly wrong.
//   - The fill depth is meaningful before either side has ever run. There is no ambiguous
//     "empty or full?" state at start-up, which is exactly when the latency is not yet known.
//
// A uint64 frame count at 96 kHz wraps after about six million years, so wrap-around is not
// handled and does not need to be.
//
// JUCE's own comment (line 1870 there) explains why its AbstractFifo could not be used for this:
// a generic SPSC ring cannot recover from under/overflow lock-free without either overwriting or
// reading stale data. The same reasoning applies here, so recovery is explicit - see ring_read().

    float *          buffer;       // interleaved, frames * channels

    _Atomic uint64_t readPos;      // absolute frames consumed by the consumer

// in which case nothing is written - dropping a block is better than tearing one.
bool     ring_write(tRing * ring, const float * src, uint32_t frames);

// Consumer side. Returns false and counts an underflow if fewer than 'frames' are available,
// in which case dst is zero-filled so the caller always has something to hand its device.
bool     ring_read(tRing * ring, float * dst, uint32_t frames);

// Frames written but not yet read. This is the quantity the drift loop steers.
uint64_t ring_fill(const tRing * ring);

// Force the fill depth to exactly 'targetFrames' by moving the READ cursor, discarding whatever
// is surplus. Consumer side only - it writes readPos, so calling it from the producer would put
// two threads on one cursor.
//
// This is how the bridge starts, and how it recovers. Waiting for the ring to fill to the
// setpoint sounds like the natural way to prime it, but it races the two devices: a device that
// is slow to deliver its first callback - a DisplayPort output takes about 160 ms - lets the
// other one run far past the setpoint first, handing the drift loop an opening error it then
// needs minutes to walk off at a few hundred ppm. Snapping the cursor makes the opening error
// zero by construction.
