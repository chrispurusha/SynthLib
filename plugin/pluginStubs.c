// The handful of functions SynthLib calls that an APPLICATION would provide and a plug-in has to.
//
// SHARED, because two projects had this file and it was the same file - GenBridge's gbAppStubs.c and
// MidiSyncTool's msAppStubs.c differed by their first comment line and nothing else. G2-Edit's
// plug-in has its own four-hundred-line version and cannot use this one yet: it links that
// application's renderer, which reaches for undo, a message queue and a module database. If that
// plug-in is ever narrowed to the panel alone, this is what it would narrow to.
//
// NOT IN SynthLib/src, for the reason in audio/device.c: that folder is synchronized into G2-Edit's
// application target, and these definitions would collide with the application's own.
//
// synthlibGlobals.c is NOT linked, for the same reason G2-Edit does not link it: its
// synthlib_request_redraw() calls glfwPostEmptyEvent(), which would drag GLFW into a plug-in that
// deliberately has none. The two functions actually reached from the renderer are provided here.

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "synthlibTypes.h"

// NOT a stub - the same job, done differently. An application posts an empty event to wake a
// blocked GLFW loop; here the panel repaints on a timer regardless, so a request needs no action.
// It is defined rather than omitted because the renderer calls it from several places, and a
// missing symbol at link time is a poorer answer than a deliberate no-op.
void synthlib_request_redraw(void) {
}

// The application's wake-the-render-loop wrapper. One line there too.
void wake_glfw(void) {
    synthlib_request_redraw();

// The panel has no dials, so the mode never comes up. Rotary is the value the sibling projects
// default to, and returning anything else would only matter if a dial appeared here.
